This example repository shows the differences between plain imperative, object based and object oriented programming.

First of all: object oriented programming is not necessary to implement appropriate programms. It only makes the source code better readable and eases implementation for programmers.

Most examples about object orienten programming are really, because they only show the abstraction "object oriented" but do not show the "programming" part. This example shows the impementation of a car park display, which counts arriving and leaving cars:

## plain imperative programming

This is the straight forward way. State variables and functions directly changing the values of these variables are written down without any idea of abstraction. This looks easy but is bad, if you want to doublicate the car park display to handle two different car parks.

## object based programming

## object oriented programming
